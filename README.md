### Aprende R y hagamos Comunidad / Develop with R and Do Community
(Cuernavaca, Mexico, July 30 - Aug 3, 2018)

In recent years, biology has seen a rise in the use of technologies that enable high-throughput, quantitative, data-rich profiling of cellular states. As a result, the field now faces  computational challenges to analyse such data. The R/Bioconductor project is an open source, open development software platform that provides tools to translate complex datasets into biological knowledge.

The workshop is aimed at students and researchers interested in the analysis of biological data. We encourage applications from experts in diverse disciplines, including but not limited to biologists, bioinformaticians, data scientists, software engineers and programmers. The main goals of the workshop are:

Teaching participants the principles of reproducible data science through the development of R/Bioconductor packages. 
Turning bioinformatic software users into bioinformatic software developers.
Fostering the exchange of expertise and establishing multidisciplinary collaborations.
Creating a community of Latin American scientists committed to the development of software and computational pipelines for biological data analysis. 
Helping to train bioinformatics instructors that can continue to grow in their local communities.

This workshop is part of a long-term project to create a community of developers from Latin America. We hope to hold regular meetings in the future (similar to BioC, EuroBioc and BioCAsia) where attendees present their own software contributions.
